	    <h1>Vision Zero for Queens Schoolkids</h1>
	    <p class="lead">Parents, politicians and community members are taking actions to make streets safer for kids going to and from school in the borough known for its “Boulevard of Death.”</p>

	     <p class="text-muted byline">By Cristina Furlong and Julia Haslanger | <a href="http://twitter.com/CristinaFurlong">@missmarty70</a> & <a href="http://twitter.com/JuliaJRH">@juliajrh</a> | April 2015</p>
	    <p>Nearly 350,000 kids travel to and from school in Queens each day. The most common way these kids die? Car crashes. The <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/ip/ip-nyc-inj-child-fatality-report13.pdf">Department of Health found</a> that a car accidents are leading cause of death for elementary and middle school-age children. And more often than not, the child killed is a pedestrian.</p>
	    <p>The city’s second-largest borough is packed with activists trying to make the streets safer for kids on foot and bike, and city agencies have joined in the effort. So what are advocates and bureaucrats are trying to make Queens streets safer?</p>
	    
	    <h2>Let's start by looking at the problem.</h2>
	    
	    <img src="http://imgur.com/pgEi1cP.png" class="img-responsive">
	    <p></p>
	    	    <h3>Queens has a reputation for being a deadly place for pedestrians.</h3>

	    <p>Queens Boulevard has been known as the Boulevard of Death <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Boulevard">for at least 20 years</a>. In 1993, 17 deaths were reported for that roadway alone. </p>
	    <p>December 2012 marked the beginning of a deadly time for children in particular in northern Queens, as the borough was rocked by the deaths of Miguel Torres, Jahair Figueroa, Drudak Tenzin, and Allison Liao, and Noshat Nahian among others through the end of 2013.</p>
	    <p>There was also <a href="http://theforumnewsgroup.com/2013/09/19/after-tragic-accident-calls-for-change-in-maspeth/">an incident</a> in September 2013 that left five kids seriously injured after a driver went up onto the sidewalk as the students were walking to school. That crash happened in Maspeth, where an estimated 4,000 students go to and from just three schools (IS 73, PS 58 and Maspeth High School).</p>
	    <p>CityLab <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/12/growing-plea-new-york-pedestrian-deaths-cannot-be-tolerated/7954/">declared in late 2013</a> that Northern Boulevard, which intersects with Queens Boulevard, “is like the uncontrolled id of the city’s driving culture.”</p>
	    <p>Progress has been slow, and focused on street redesigns, which require lengthy studies and funding to complete. It may take up to 7 years from a street redesign to become applied, and in the meantime, there are still injuries and fatalities. It wasn’t until Vision Zero, the mayor’s plan to reduce traffic fatalities was announced in 2014 that a combined effort with city agencies was finally put in place.</p>

<p>More than 400 pedestrians and bikers were killed in New York City by motor vehicles since 2012. Is your neighborhood a hotspot for pedestrian or bike deaths in car accidents? (Can you find the "Boulevard of Death" (Queens Boulevard)?</p>
<p>Vision Zero also maintains <a href="http://www.nycvzv.info">a map</a> where you can view how many injuries and deaths have happened in your community district.</p>

	    	 <h2>So who's trying to fix this?</h2>
	    	 <h3>Queens groups have been multiplying and growing in the last few years to address the concerns about street safety.</h3>
<p>Ella Bandes was 23 when she was killed by an MTA bus, and the vigil held on January 26th, 2014, brought together community groups from across the city to Ridgewood, Queens. The event marked the beginning of an organized, empowered and relentless advocacy push that would result in the founding of Families for Safe Streets and the passing of 9 pieces of legislation, a reduction in the speed limit city-wide and stiffer penalties for certain traffic crimes.</p>
<h4>An overview of the major advocacy groups</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.transalt.org/getinvolved/neighborhood/queens">Transportation Alternatives Queens Activist Committee</a> has worked for safe streets, and redesigns from 21st St, Queensbridge to Queens Boulevard where they co-hosted a rally with Families for Safe Streets.</li>
<li><a href="http://transalt.org/getinvolved/familiesforsafestreets">Families for Safe Streets</a> members represent all five boroughs and loved ones of every age who were killed in traffic violence.  They are responsible for  pieces of legislation and a reduced speed limit being approved in less than 6 months time. The staid and steady determination in honor of the youngest children Sammy Cohen Eckstein, 12, Lucien Merriweather, 9, Cooper Stock, 9,  Ariel Russo, 4, and Allison Liao, 3, has forever changed the fiber of debate on safe streets. </li>
<li><a href="http://makequeenssafer.org/home/news/">Make Queens Safer</a> has worked throughout the borough by hosting community events such as street safety fairs, family bike rides, and outreach to neighborhood groups to bring the issues of schools safety to the forefront. They have worked with PTA’s at a handful of schools to connect them with free and readily available DOT programming. In the last few months, MQS has had several key meetings with state senators, council members and NYPD precincts to draw attention to dangers including unsafe/reckless driving, speeding, and unticketed moving violations that happen near schools. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Local leaders getting involved in top-down advocacy</h3>
<p>intro text</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer (D26)</b>
Suffering the loss of 16 year old Tenzing Dudek in March of 2013, and the loss of Noshat Nahian, 8, in December of the same year, the council member pro-actively set up school safety meetings in his district, as well as sponsoring “Justice for Hit and Run Victims” Intro 371, which went into law in September. </li>
<li><b>Council Member Dan Dromm (D25)</b>
Sponsored 2 neighborhood slow zones in the district, which came with curb extensions, speed reductions to 15 mph near schools and and gateway signs to let drivers know they are in a slow zone. </li>
<li><b>State Senator Toby Stavisky (D16th Senate District) </b>
	Working closely with PS 173 in Queens, she has helped the school create a safety plan for arrivals and dismissals, as well as sponsored legislation calling for a driver’s license to be revoked in the case of a fatality. </li>
	</ul>
<h3>City agencies are ramping up their efforts, too.</h3>
<p>Before we get any further, we should probably explain to you what Vision Zero is. Vision Zero is a coordinated effort of the NYPD, Department of Transportation, Department of Health and the Taxi and Limousine Commission to work towards the goal of zero traffic fatalities in the city. The effort started in 2014 under Mayor Bill DiBlasio's direction, and he made the big announcement about launching Vision Zero from an event in Queens.</p>

<h4>Department of Transportation</h4>
<p>The Department of Transportation has the brunt of the responsibility for establishing Vision Zero in the city. Their efforts on school safety go beyond the street redesign and detailed traffic studies. They also make <a href="http://a841-dotweb01.nyc.gov/SSML/">specific maps</a> and plans for many of the schools in New York City, and hold safety education trainings.</p>
<div class="row">		
<p><b>Priority Schools</b></p>
	<div class="col-md-4">

<p>One effort by the Department of Transportation has been to identify <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/saferoutes.shtml">“priority” schools</a> to focus efforts on. Each priority school “receives an individualized planning study which determines both short-term and long-term measures to improve safety,” according to DOT. The schools are a mix of public and private, and each school receives a personalized study and plan for improving child safety. DOT is on its second round of priority schools. Learn more about the 33 Queens schools selected for the second round using the map to the right. </p>
<p><b>Safety Education </b></p>
<p>There is an extensive list of safety materials and information available from the department, and these are distributed widely. A <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/m5z6whgbd2n6to1/Vision_Zero_Education_Program_C_Catalog_v5.pdf?dl=0">full catalog</a> of safety education materials broken out by grade level is available for educators. Teacher training and site visits are two core ways of doing safety education. (Are you a parent or teacher? Interested individuals can request DOT safety training by contacting <a href="mailto:cjohnson1@dot.nyc.gov"> Cheryl Johnson</a>.)</p>
