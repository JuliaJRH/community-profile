	    <h1>Vision Zero for Queens Schoolkids</h1>
	    <p class="lead">Parents, politicians and community members are taking actions to make streets safer for kids going to and from school in the borough known for its “Boulevard of Death.”</p>
	  </div><!-- /jumbotron -->
	     <p class="text-muted byline">By Cristina Furlong and Julia Haslanger | <a href="http://twitter.com/CristinaFurlong">@missmarty70</a> & <a href="http://twitter.com/JuliaJRH">@juliajrh</a> | April 2015</p>
	    <p>Nearly 350,000 kids travel to and from school in Queens each day. The most common way these kids die? Car crashes. The <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/ip/ip-nyc-inj-child-fatality-report13.pdf">Department of Health found</a> that a car accidents are leading cause of death for elementary and middle school-age children. And more often than not, the child killed is a pedestrian.</p>
	    <p>The city’s second-largest borough is packed with activists trying to make the streets safer for kids on foot and bike, and city agencies have joined in the effort. So what are advocates and bureaucrats are trying to make Queens streets safer?</p>
	    
	    <h2>Let's start by looking at the problem.</h2>
	    
	    <img src="http://imgur.com/pgEi1cP.png" class="img-responsive">
	    <p></p>
	    	    <h3>Queens has a reputation for being a deadly place for pedestrians.</h3>

	    <p>Queens Boulevard has been known as the Boulevard of Death <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Boulevard">for at least 20 years</a>. In 1993, 17 deaths were reported for that roadway alone. </p>
	    <p>December 2012 marked the beginning of a deadly time for children in particular in northern Queens, as the borough was rocked by the deaths of Miguel Torres, Jahair Figueroa, Drudak Tenzin, and Allison Liao, and Noshat Nahian among others through the end of 2013.</p>
	    <p>There was also <a href="http://theforumnewsgroup.com/2013/09/19/after-tragic-accident-calls-for-change-in-maspeth/">an incident</a> in September 2013 that left five kids seriously injured after a driver went up onto the sidewalk as the students were walking to school. That crash happened in Maspeth, where an estimated 4,000 students go to and from just three schools (IS 73, PS 58 and Maspeth High School).</p>
	    <p>CityLab <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/12/growing-plea-new-york-pedestrian-deaths-cannot-be-tolerated/7954/">declared in late 2013</a> that Northern Boulevard, which intersects with Queens Boulevard, “is like the uncontrolled id of the city’s driving culture.”</p>

	    <p>Progress has been slow, and focused on street redesigns, which require lengthy studies and funding to complete. It may take up to 7 years from a street redesign to become applied, and in the meantime, there are still injuries and fatalities. It wasn’t until Vision Zero, the mayor’s plan to reduce traffic fatalities was announced in 2014 that a combined effort with city agencies was finally put in place.</p>

	    	 <h2>So who's trying to fix this?</h2>
	    	 <h3>Queens groups have been multiplying and growing in the last few years to address the concerns about street safety.</h3>
<p>Ella Bandes was 23 when she was killed by an MTA bus, and the vigil held on January 26th, 2014, brought together community groups from across the city to Ridgewood, Queens. The event marked the beginning of an organized, empowered and relentless advocacy push that would result in the founding of Families for Safe Streets and the passing of 9 pieces of legislation, a reduction in the speed limit city-wide and stiffer penalties for certain traffic crimes.</p>
<h4>An overview of the major advocacy groups</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.transalt.org/getinvolved/neighborhood/queens">Transportation Alternatives Queens Activist Committee</a> has worked for safe streets, and redesigns from 21st St, Queensbridge to Queens Boulevard where they co-hosted a rally with Families for Safe Streets.</li>
<li><a href="http://transalt.org/getinvolved/familiesforsafestreets">Families for Safe Streets</a> members represent all five boroughs and loved ones of every age who were killed in traffic violence.  They are responsible for  pieces of legislation and a reduced speed limit being approved in less than 6 months time. The staid and steady determination in honor of the youngest children Sammy Cohen Eckstein, 12, Lucien Merriweather, 9, Cooper Stock, 9,  Ariel Russo, 4, and Allison Liao, 3, has forever changed the fiber of debate on safe streets. </li>
<li><a href="http://makequeenssafer.org/home/news/">Make Queens Safer</a> has worked throughout the borough by hosting community events such as street safety fairs, family bike rides, and outreach to neighborhood groups to bring the issues of schools safety to the forefront. They have worked with PTA’s at a handful of schools to connect them with free and readily available DOT programming. In the last few months, MQS has had several key meetings with state senators, council members and NYPD precincts to draw attention to dangers including unsafe/reckless driving, speeding, and unticketed moving violations that happen near schools. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Local leaders getting involved in top-down advocacy</h3>
<p>intro text</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer (D26)</b>
Suffering the loss of 16 year old Tenzing Dudek in March of 2013, and the loss of Noshat Nahian, 8, in December of the same year, the council member pro-actively set up school safety meetings in his district, as well as sponsoring “Justice for Hit and Run Victims” Intro 371, which went into law in September. </li>
<li><b>Council Member Dan Dromm (D25)</b>
Sponsored 2 neighborhood slow zones in the district, which came with curb extensions, speed reductions to 15 mph near schools and and gateway signs to let drivers know they are in a slow zone. </li>
<li><b>State Senator Toby Stavisky (D16th Senate District) </b>
	Working closely with PS 173 in Queens, she has helped the school create a safety plan for arrivals and dismissals, as well as sponsored legislation calling for a driver’s license to be revoked in the case of a fatality. </li>
	</ul>
<h3>City agencies are ramping up their efforts, too.</h3>
<p>Before we get any further, we should probably explain to you what Vision Zero is. Vision Zero is a coordinated effort of the NYPD, Department of Transportation, Department of Health and the Taxi and Limousine Commission to work towards the goal of zero traffic fatalities in the city. The effort started in 2014 under Mayor Bill DiBlasio's direction, and he made the big announcement about launching Vision Zero from an event in Queens.</p>

<h4>Department of Transportation</h4>
<p>The Department of Transportation has the brunt of the responsibility for establishing Vision Zero in the city. Their efforts on school safety go beyond the street redesign and detailed traffic studies. They also make <a href="http://a841-dotweb01.nyc.gov/SSML/">specific maps</a> and plans for many of the schools in New York City, and hold safety education trainings.</p>
<div class="row">		
<p><b>Priority Schools</b></p>
	<div class="col-md-4">

<p>One effort by the Department of Transportation has been to identify <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/saferoutes.shtml">“priority” schools</a> to focus efforts on. Each priority school “receives an individualized planning study which determines both short-term and long-term measures to improve safety,” according to DOT. The schools are a mix of public and private, and each school receives a personalized study and plan for improving child safety. DOT is on its second round of priority schools. Learn more about the 33 Queens schools selected for the second round using the map to the right. </p>
<p><b>Safety Education </b></p>
<p>There is an extensive list of safety materials and information available from the department, and these are distributed widely. A <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/m5z6whgbd2n6to1/Vision_Zero_Education_Program_C_Catalog_v5.pdf?dl=0">full catalog</a> of safety education materials broken out by grade level is available for educators. Teacher training and site visits are two core ways of doing safety education. (Are you a parent or teacher? Interested individuals can request DOT safety training by contacting <a href="mailto:cjohnson1@dot.nyc.gov"> Cheryl Johnson</a>.)</p>

<p>Another aspect of DOT safety education is <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/safety-city.shtml">Safety City</a>. It is an off-site field trip program for 3rd graders the involves a full day of safety training. Unfortunately, the program has lost its location in Queens, thus reducing the number of children who are able to take the class trip to the two surviving locations: Harlem and Staten Island.</p> 
</div>
<div class="row">

	<h4>NYPD</h4>
	 	<div class="col-md-4">

	<p>The Vision Zero plan for New York City utilizes NYPD data to target enforcement areas for critical safety improvements based on collisions and poor street design. The addition of <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2014-10-speed-camera-faq.pdf">140 speed cameras</a>, which operate in schools zones have been effective in reducing speeds as well as injury around schools.</p>
<p><b>Crossing guards</b></p>
	<p>However, NYPD has been slow to improve the working conditions and overall number of school crossing guards on the streets dedicated to providing safe crossing for our children. Currently, there are no plans to increase the number of crossing guards, despite an aggressive push for new school construction, including <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/Elementary/newschools"></a>three new elementary schools in Queens</a> by this fall.</p>
	<p>At a March city council hearing on public safety, Council Members Vanessa Gibson (D16, Bronx), Rory Lanceman (D24, Queens), and Corey Johnson (D3, Manhattan) all questioned Commissioner Bratton on why more than hundred vacancies for crossing guards exist. </p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
	<img src="http://imgur.com/dKSDeyA.png" class="img-responsive"/>
</div>
<p><b>Traffic agents</b></p>
	<p>The NYPD is also in charge of school safety officers and traffic agents. At times these other officers are tasked with crossing guard duties, but there is no agency standard on when those officers must step in. In cases of injury or death at a crossing location, traffic agents with the authority to write tickets are sent to the scene, but only periodically and usually stay for just 72 hours after an incident.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h4>Department of Education</h4>
<div class="col-md-4">

<p>Serving over 350,000 school kids in Queens, in 7 distinct school districts, the Department of Education could take on a priority role in keeping kids safe, but isn’t a major participant in Vision Zero plans. Each school is required to have a school safety plan and a safety committee, which meets monthly, but  the safety plans don’t mention guidelines for pedestrian safety issues the children face. Individual school safety plans could (but don’t) include specific actions related to school pick-up and drop off of students. As it stands, cars, city and school buses and parents themselves are putting kids at risk with erratic, impatient driving, parking in crosswalks, or double parking in a manner that has school busses dropping off children in the street. It’s up to schools Chancellor Carmen Farina to provide a mandate to make such a safety plan include street safety plans.

</div>
<h4>Department of Health</h4>
<p>The DOE could find direction by looking at materials created by the Department of Health, whose district public health offices in Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx created the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/dpho/getting-to-scool.pdf">Getting to School Neighborhood Report</a> which researched and reported on methods to improve the commute to school for city kids. The study neglected Queens, however. Citing that over 60 percent of kids in the research area walked to school, it encourages safe, active transportation methods. This report should be given funding to be recreated for all school districts, and fully implemented by school through health and wellness programs.</p>

<h3>Oh yeah, and the kids aren't just waiting for the grown-ups to get it together.</h3>

<p>Preston Liao lost his best buddy, sister Allison when she was only three years old. </p>
<p>Providing children a safe and healthy environment in which to grow and thrive should be a priority for everyone. Though many measures have been taken and some success has been made, when children are denied their chance to grow up, they leave behind not only their parents, but siblings, friends and classmates who will always remember them. Preston’s P.S.173 in Fresh Meadows still has many issues with driver disregard of the school zone.</p>
