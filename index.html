	    <p>Nearly 350,000 kids travel to and from school in Queens each day. The <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/ip/ip-nyc-inj-child-fatality-report13.pdf">Department of Health found</a> that a car accidents are leading cause of death for elementary and middle school-age children across the city.

	    <p>The city's second-largest borough is packed with activists trying to make the streets safer for kids on foot and bike, and city agencies have joined in the effort. So what are advocates and bureaucrats are trying to make Queens streets safer?</p>
	    
	    <h2>Let's start by looking at the problem.</h2>
	    <p> </p>

	    <p> </p>
	    	    <h3>Queens has a reputation for being a deadly place for pedestrians.</h3>

	    <p>Queens Boulevard has been known as the Boulevard of Death <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Boulevard">for at least 20 years</a>. In 1993, 17 deaths were reported for that roadway alone. </p>
	    <p>December 2012 marked the beginning of a deadly time for children in particular in northern Queens, as the borough was rocked by the deaths of <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121230/jackson-heights/family-seeks-justice-for-11-year-old-killed-by-dump-truck-hit-and-run">Miguel Torres</a>, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-driver-killed-boy-3-charged-dwi-article-1.1483728">Jahair Figueroa</a>, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/van_driver_who_killed_teen_on_queen.php">Drudak Tenzin</a>, <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2014/11/07/new-york-state-dmv-dismisses-tickets-to-driver-who-killed-toddler-allie-liao/">Allison Liao</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/nyregion/boy-8-fatally-struck-by-tractor-trailer-in-queens.html?_r=0">Noshat Nahian</a> among others through the end of 2013.</p>
	    <p>There was also an incident in September 2013 that <a href="http://theforumnewsgroup.com/2013/09/19/after-tragic-accident-calls-for-change-in-maspeth/">left five kids seriously injured</a> after a driver went up onto the sidewalk as the students were walking to school. That crash happened in Maspeth, where an estimated 4,000 students go to and from just three schools (IS 73, PS 58 and Maspeth High School).</p>
	    <p>CityLab <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/12/growing-plea-new-york-pedestrian-deaths-cannot-be-tolerated/7954/">declared in late 2013</a> that Northern Boulevard, which intersects with Queens Boulevard, "is like the uncontrolled id of the city’s driving culture."</p>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-12">
	<p>The danger on the streets (and sidewalks) for kids is real &mdash; hundreds of kids who are biking or walking are injured each year in Queens.</p>

</div>	    
	    <p>Progress has been slow and focused on street redesigns, which require lengthy studies and funding to complete. It may take up to seven years from a street redesign to become applied, and in the meantime, there are still injuries and fatalities. It wasn't until Vision Zero, the mayor’s plan to reduce traffic fatalities was announced in 2014 that a combined effort with city agencies was finally put in place.</p>
<div class="row">		
	<h4>A birds-eye view of crashes</h4>

	<div class="col-md-2">
<p>More than 400 pedestrians and bikers were killed in New York City by motor vehicles since 2012. And, 20% of those injuries and fatalities were children. Is your neighborhood a hotspot for pedestrian or bike deaths in car accidents? (Can you spot the "Boulevard of Death" (Queens Boulevard)?)</p>
<p>Vision Zero also maintains <a href="http://www.nycvzv.info">a map</a> where you can view how many injuries and deaths have happened in your community district.</p>

<h3>City agencies are ramping up their efforts, too.</h3>
<p>Before we get any further, we should probably explain to you what Vision Zero is. Vision Zero is a coordinated effort of the NYPD, Department of Transportation, Department of Health and the Taxi and Limousine Commission to work towards the goal of zero traffic fatalities in the city. The effort started in January 2014 under Mayor Bill DiBlasio's direction. DiBlasio announced the Vision Zero plan from an elementary school in Queens where an 8-year-old was killed crossing Northern Blvd on his way to school.</p>

<h4>Department of Transportation</h4>
<p>The Department of Transportation has the brunt of the responsibility for establishing Vision Zero in the city. Their efforts on school safety go beyond the street redesign and detailed traffic studies. They also make <a href="http://a841-dotweb01.nyc.gov/SSML/">specific maps</a> and plans for many of the schools in New York City (including Queens), and hold safety education trainings.</p>
<div class="row">		
<p><b>Priority Schools</b></p>
	<div class="col-md-4">

<p>One effort by the Department of Transportation has been to identify <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/saferoutes.shtml">"priority" schools</a> to focus efforts on. Each priority school "receives an individualized planning study which determines both short-term and long-term measures to improve safety," according to DOT. The schools are a mix of public and private, and each school receives a personalized study and plan for improving child safety. DOT is on its second round of priority schools. Learn more about the 33 Queens schools selected for the second round using the map to the right. </p>

<h2>What Queens schools get safety education traning from the DOT?</h2>
<p>The Department of Transportation did outreach at 700 schools, but that leaves more than 1,000 schools unvisited. See the schools where outreached happened:</p>

<p>Another aspect of DOT safety education is <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/safety-city.shtml">Safety City</a>. It is an off-site field trip program for 3rd graders the involves a full day of safety training. Unfortunately, the program has lost its location in Queens, thus reducing the number of children who are able to take the class trip to the two remaining locations: Harlem and Staten Island.</p>

	<h4>NYPD</h4>
	 	<div class="col-md-4">

	<p>The Vision Zero plan for New York City utilizes NYPD data to target enforcement areas for critical safety improvements based on collisions and poor street design. The addition of <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2014-10-speed-camera-faq.pdf">140 speed cameras</a>, which operate in schools zones have been effective in reducing speeds as well as injury around schools.</p>
<p><b>Crossing guards</b></p>
	<p>However, NYPD has been slow to improve the working conditions and overall number of school crossing guards on the streets dedicated to providing safe crossing for our children. Currently, there are no plans to increase the number of crossing guards, despite an aggressive push for new school construction, including <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/Elementary/newschools">three new elementary schools in Queens</a> by this fall.</p>
	
	
</div>
<div class="row">
<h4>Department of Education</h4>
<div class="col-md-4">

<p>Serving over 350,000 school kids in Queens, in seven distinct school districts, the Department of Education could take on a priority role in keeping kids safe, yet it isn't a major participant in Vision Zero plans. Each school is required to have a school safety plan and a safety committee, which meets monthly, but the safety plans don’t mention guidelines for pedestrian safety issues the children face. Individual school safety plans could (but don't) include specific actions related to school pick-up and drop off of students. As it stands, cars, city and school buses and parents themselves are putting kids at risk with erratic, impatient driving, parking in crosswalks, or double parking in a manner that has school busses dropping off children in the street. It's up to schools Chancellor Carmen Farina to provide a mandate to make such a safety plan include street safety plans.

<h4>Department of Health</h4>
<p>The DOE could find direction by looking at materials created by the Department of Health, whose district public health offices in Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx created the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/dpho/getting-to-scool.pdf">Getting to School Neighborhood Report</a> which researched and reported on methods to improve the commute to school for city kids. Citing that over 60 percent of kids in the research area walked to school, it encourages safe, active transportation methods. The study did not include neighborhoods in Queens, however. The borough would benefit from this report being given funding to be recreated for all school districts, and fully implemented by school through health and wellness programs.</p>

<h3>Kids aren't just waiting for the grown-ups to get it together.</h3>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">

<p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VisionZeroYouthCouncil">Vision Zero Youth Council</a> formed after three children, alumni and current students of M.S. 51 in Brooklyn were killed in traffic violence. The youth council works to honor their memories with lobbying and advocacy, and is open to students from 4th to 12th grade.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://makequeenssafer.org/home/kid-engineers-traffic-study/">Kids Engineering Traffic Study</a> brought students from a handful of schools together to document traffic conditions, including speed (using radar guns) and behavior of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians (using observation techniques). It was part of the Safer Greener Street Fair sponsored by Make Queens Safer in Jackson Heights.</p>
