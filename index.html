	    <p>Motor vehicle collision are the leading cause of injury death in children aged 5 to 9, according to the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/ip/ip-nyc-inj-child-fatality-report13.pdf">2013 Child Fatality Report</a> issued by the NYC Department of Health. From 2002 to 2011, 44 children were killed citywide. Eighty percent of those children were pedestrians. </p>
	    <p>And the issue isn't just limited to younger children. For kids between 10 and 14, the number killed in car collisions was actually higher: 57 children, and 68% of those were pedestrians.</p>
	    <p>More recently, 30 children aged 4 to 17 have been killed in traffic violence in New York City since 2012, according to data compiled by <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org">Streetsblog</a>, a transportation advocacy news source in New York. </p>
